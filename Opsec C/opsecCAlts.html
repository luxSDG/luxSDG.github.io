          Opsec D:
          <br>
          -This is a PvE version of Opsec C in which you play detective against AI enemies and try to figure out who the agents are, or destroy Netsec from within.
          <br>
          <br>
          Opsec R (Revival):
          <br>
          -The game lasts for X days. Determined by the players. Any number of players (preferably greater than 4) can play this opsec. The game starts on Prep night and ends on Day X.
          <br>
          -Every player gets a starting role. Every player can “revive” an infinite number of times as a new operative, in that Netsec, Agents, and other operatives would love to join the opsec.
          <br>
          -Upon getting arrested, killed, or voted, players can respawn as a random role.
          <br>
          -There may be no Agents or W3C during a specific phase after voting out remaining Agents or W3C. The game does not end until Agents, W3C, or Netsec win.
          <br>
          -There may be no Operation Leader at certain phases of the game (including the start). Unique roles still maintain uniqueness throughout the game.
          <br>
          -In smaller games, Agents, W3C, and Paragon can be a single player (operative) at each interval of the game, yet representing two roles. This player gets to have 2 actions per day and night, one per role. This will be indicated by the passive below:
          <br>
          -One Man Operation - You have been assigned with full access to all of Agent/W3C/Paragon resources. You are two roles, the only operative on your team, but can take one action per role, per phase.
          <br>
          -Follow, occupation, and any other night ability will affect the target's highest priority action (e.g. arrest, murder, etc).
          <br>
          -Every so often, there will be Deals from every faction trying to convince players to become other roles, potentially with other win conditions, or higher priority roles. Accepting a Deal will change your role in the next phase and have your current phase’s action go through.
          <br>
          -The Deal text is similar to: “Someone knocks on your door, they are Netsec/not Netsec (any faction that isn’t Netsec)”. This way you cannot metagame which factions are in the game currently.
          <br>
          -Win condition is an aggregate sum score based on good play, along with winning when you can.
          <br>
          -For now, a general scoring system will do. We can adjust this more in the future. You will not know your score till the end of the game to prevent metagaming.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;+50 Starting Agent win condition
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;+30 Agent, W3C, NK, difficult neutral win condition
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;+15 Netsec, Paragon win condition
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;+10 Neutral win condition
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;+5 opposing faction (not if you are neutral) execution (and vote)
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;+3 taking a deal that changes win condition to not Netsec, or OL
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;+1 action that benefits your team
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;-3 same faction (not if you are neutral) kill or arrest
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;-5 same faction (not if you are neutral) execution (and vote)
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;-10 afk
          <br>
          -Many abilities, win conditions, and balance changes are adjusted. See each role for more details.
          <br>
          -We can have bans, pick/ban, etc as per usual.
          <br>
          -”When the trusted becomes Untrusted”.
