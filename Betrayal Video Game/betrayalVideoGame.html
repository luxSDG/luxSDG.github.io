          Betrayal put into a video game format. There will be obvious differences from the rather subjective way Betrayal is run (Org style), but many key mechanics will be retained.
          <br>
          <br>
          A goal of this project that pen and paper Betrayal does not have is that there is a very significant rigidness to the game itself. I think Betrayal has a lot of potential in many different directions and the limitations (especially due to trying to force the social aspect of the game) make it difficult to innovate and create fun experiences. With rulesets we can maintain more hardcore variants of Betrayal and also create more casual and fun experiences as well.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you want to look at the design document, the design document is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZIqC87ohZpkbfQ2R076S45InMGNCfQjL3Id-uI3EL_k/edit?usp=sharing
          <br>
          <br>
          Rulesets: 
          <br>
          Lux’s Fastrayal - The version I will focus on the most, which tries to move away from the social aspect of the game and push more mechanical aspects (with light social elements). 
          <br>
          Classical Betrayal - Tries to stay as similar to core Betrayal as possible. 
          <br>
          OMEGAPOGGERS Betrayal - The URF/Imba mode of Betrayal (Fastrayal). Cooldowns/charges modified heavily and includes respawns, where the goal is to get as many points as possible by the end of the game (whether it be staying alive, or kills, or damage done, etc).
          <br>
          <br>
          Overall Lobby Creation:
          <br>
          -Public vs Private (password/room code) lobbies
          <br>
          -Master Client vs Player vs Spectator (Master Client has full access to all settings, kicking, etc; Spectator should only have access to watching general chat, roles, actions done/inventories)
          <br>
          <br>
          Each room/game should have the following settings and functionality:
          <br>
          -Rulesets: pick one of the above
          <br>
          -Roles: All random vs pick vs Deceptionist’s Choice (pick 1 of 3 random); unique vs non-unique (pick will not allow unique); visible picks vs not visible to anyone but player; role banlist/disabled roles
          <br>
          A tab to show disabled/enabled roles
          <br>
          -Anonymous: Pick name vs random name vs non-anonymous
          <br>
          -Teams: Max number of teams; pick or random teams
          <br>
          A tab to show number of teams, size of each team, and metrics of coin bonus/luck/IC chances per team, like having 1 team have 3 people, another team with 5 people
          <br>
          -Time per day/round: 1 minute to 10 minutes, default is 5.
          <br>
          -Coin Bonus starting 0% to 1000%, 100% intervals, default is 50%.
          <br>
          -Luck starting 0 to 100 luck, 5 intervals, default is 5.
          <br>
          -IC chances from 0% to 100%, default is 30%.
          <br>
          -Carepackage: Default to 1 item
          <br>
          -Item drop: Default to 1 per day for now
          <br>
          -Power drop: Default to 1 per day for now (not yet done)
          <br>
          -Alliance hopping: enabled or disabled (for now we will not have this feature until from a tech perspective it is possible)
          <br>
          -No RNG vs some RNG vs All RNG - Remove luck and bake that into money entirely, or disable the shop, or have both.
          <br>
          -Shop Toggle: Make a shop to buy EVERY item and AA.
          <br>
          -Sell items/AAs: Allow a certain amount of value to be gained for selling items from 0% to 100%.
          <br>
          -Item and AA banning/not on sale: Make each individual item and AA banned or not on sale.
          <br>
          -Spectator vs Player
          <br>
          <br>
          After Lobby/Out of Game:
          <br>
          -Results per game, stats page end of game showing end game inventories, roles, etc
          <br>
          -AWS Accounts/backend + Achievements and saving stats
          <br>
          <br>
          Hp
          <br>
          Voting is replaced by an HP system, in which each person can choose to deal damage to other players every day, which deals the damage at the end of the day. Only one attack may be done per day unless stated otherwise, and only not immune players are attacked at the end.
          <br>
          This only exists in Fastrayal, but I think this implementation is very versatile and more interesting than default Betrayal.
          <br>
          <br>
          Statuses
          <br>
          Curse - Deals 3 damage in 1 day.
          <br>
          Death Curse - Deals 5 damage in 1 day, can only be removed by Blessing.
          <br>
          Frozen - You can’t use any abilities until you thaw out. 1/3 chance you’ll thaw for each half day passing. Thaws out in 1 day if not thawed out. Immediately deals 1 damage (which cannot be made immune).
          <br>
          Paralyzed - You have a half day cooldown before you can use another ability and item. Lasts for 1 day. Immediately deals 1 damage (which cannot be made immune).
          <br>
          Burning - Lose an item from rarity descending immediately and 1 more in 1 day. You can't pass items whilst burning. Immediately deals 1 damage (which cannot be made immune).
          <br>
          Empowered - You can use any one of your items or abilities for 2 days, even if you ran out of them. When you use a Common or Uncommon item or ability, it's a 1/4 day cooldown before you can use another, and if it is Rare or above, or unique, it’s on a 1/2 day cooldown.
          <br>
          Drunk - 25% chance to target a random person instead when using an item or an ability. Wears off after 1 day. This effect stacks.
          <br>
          Restrained - Cannot use abilities. Lasts for 1 day.
          <br>
          Disabled - You cannot attack until the next day.
          <br>
          Blackmailed - Either you give 300 coins to the blackmailer, or you take 2 damage before you do another action. If no decision or cure for 1 day, give 300 coins if possible or deal damage to yourself if not.
          <br>
          Despair - You attack yourself at the start of the next day.
          <br>
          Lucky - 2x luck, 1.5x coins for 1 day.
          <br>
          Unlucky - 0.5x luck, 0.5x coins for 1 day.
          <br>
          Death Immune - Can’t be damaged by the singular attack per day for 1 day.
