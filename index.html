        <p class="lead mb-4"><small>Welcome to my webpage in which I use to help host my beloved social deduction, pen and paper, and other games. These projects are entirely non-profit, use discord as a method of pen and paper gameplay, and are entirely inhouse- everyone hosting and playing are vouched by me. The games are hosted for fun and socializing with friends as a primary motivator and nothing else: I do not want toxicity or unhealthy gameplay in my games. If you are problematic, I will kick you from my servers, I do not have the bandwidth to constantly moderate chat. Use your general human decency to play my games.

        More importantly, the reason this page exists is to make a better user interface than using google documents or google spreadsheets to look at the different games, roles, rulesets, and more of each game. Especially with how dense games that I have created have become, I have created a portal that lists basic rules, and every single possible role, along with a table of contents and summary of each role, and a search functionality. This allows for easier loading of roles and rulesets, and faster finding specific roles.

        Opsec C is a spinoff of Untrusted, a hacking/social deduction game made by Knu. The big difference besides a massive ruleset with many changes from the base ruleset, a reworked hacking system, and multiple massive factions and additions to the role roster is that Opsec C runs on the basis of each player having "ownership" of multiple operatives, creating an entirely new gameplay loop that doesn't exist or overlap with the base game. Generally, a majority of players will still be trying to rid any hostile threats, including Agents, W3C, Neutral Killers, and more, and these minority operatives will try to remove all Netsec and other hostile threats. Neutrals and Paragon in between will try to complete their respective objectives and play different sides to remove the majority, Netsec. With many added roles, changed win conditions, multiple operatives, and overhauled hacking, the game has evolved far from base Untrusted. Still, major concepts such as the hacking itself, different base roles, and day/night cycle are all from Knu. This project is a nonprofit game, all credit goes to Knu on these features.

        Eternally Written takes the concepts of Eternal Return and Immortal Soul: Black Survial, and create a mash of components that harbor its own gameplay loop, focusing on pen and paper mechanics through unique gameplay, although taking concepts, characters, and ideas from the original games. A very short summary of the game is pokemon-minecraft-DnD-betrayal, in which players can select characters/roles that are similar to DnD roles and overall rulesets that can craft items to become stronger, get levels to become stronger, and battle in a way that is similar to pokemon or DnD, selecting moves in turn based combat. The social aspects are somewhat similar to betrayal, which create a unique dynamic in this game. This game can exist as a Player vs Player game, or a Player vs Host/Enemy game in which the Hosts create a map and enemies to fight against. Many features come from Nimble Neuron, such as characters, items, map, and more, but the gameplay loop of having different abilities, passives, and a more real life day by day ruleset in a DnD style is different from what Nimble Neuron made for Eternal Return or Immortal Soul: Black Survival.

        Betrayal Evolved is a spinoff of Betrayal, a pen and paper social deduction battle royale game hosted on Discord as well. Work in progress.
