          <br>
          <br>
          This tutorial shows all the basic mechanics outside of combat. We’ll assume a player chooses to play as Aya. Aya chooses to start in Alley.
          <br>
          <br>
          Aya
          <br>
          Location: Alley
          <br>
          Statuses: None
          <br>
          Equipped Items: Walther PPK, X, X, X, X, X
          <br>
          Inventory: 2 Bread, 2 Water
          <br>
          HP: 100/100
          <br>
          Attack Power: 1
          <br>
          Basic Attack: 10 damage
          <br>
          Credits: 10
          <br>
          Level: 1 (0 XP)
          <br>
          <br>
          The character card looks like the above. Aya will first get items and finish the item situation: given that it is day 1, 5 distributions will drop as follows:
          <br>
          <br>
          Blue: Motor, Derringer, 4 Steak
          <br>
          Green 1: Boots, 4 Hamburger, Gold
          <br>
          Green 2: Leather Jacket, Heated Stone, Quiver
          <br>
          White 1: Fountain Pen, Lighter, Milk
          <br>
          White 2: Oil, Paper, Feather
          <br>
          <br>
          Aya picks a Motor, 4 Hamburger, Leather Jacket, Fountain Pen, and Paper. Aya decides to Disassemble the Motor into an Electronic Parts and Scrap Metal. Aya crafts Fountain Pen and Paper into Blueprint, which then is crafted into a Cell Phone with the Electronic Parts. The Leather Jacket is also disassembled to a Windbreaker and Leather. The Leather combines with the Walther PPK to create a Beretta M92F. The Beretta M92F can combine with the Cell Phone to create an Electron Blaster, leaving a Windbreaker, a Scrap Metal, and 4 Hamburgers.
          <br>
          <br>
          Afterwards, Aya decides to kill animals to become stronger.
          <br>
          <br>
          Alley:
          <br>
          2 Chicken
          <br>
          1 Wild Dog
          <br>
          2 Wolves
          <br>
          1 Bear
          <br>
          <br>
          With these animals, Aya kills 2 Chickens, using a Basic Attack (10 damage) and Double Shot (10 damage). This is how killing the Chickens work: Chickens have 1 HP. Aya has 10 damage on a basic attack and 10 damage on the ability Double Shot. Aya uses the basic attack which deals 10 damage to the 1 HP chicken and kills it, and does the same using Double Shot.
          <br>
          <br>
          She gains 2 XP and 2 Credits with these, along with 2 random items. Let’s say 1 item is Leather, and 1 item is Meat. Aya will cook 2 Hamburgers with the Meat and Bread, and a Leather Jacket again with the Leather. Aya also chooses to move into Avenue to continue to scale.
          <br>
          <br>
          Aya’s role card looks like this after these actions and a day passing:
          <br>
          <br>
          Aya
          <br>
          Location: Avenue
          <br>
          Statuses: None
          <br>
          Equipped Items: Electron Blaster, Leather Jacket, X, X, X, X
          <br>
          Inventory: 6 Hamburger, 1 Bread, 2 Water, 1 Scrap Metal
          <br>
          HP: 105/105
          <br>
          Attack Power: 20
          <br>
          Basic Attack: 10 damage
          <br>
          First Basic Attack Damage: 5
          <br>
          Credits: 22
          <br>
          Level: 2 (2 XP)
          <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fight Scenario</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          Let’s say our Aya above gets into a fight with Hyunwoo, who entered Avenue as well.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hyunwoo
          <br>
          Location: Avenue
          <br>
          Statuses: None
          <br>
          Equipped Items: Brasil Gauntlet, X, X, X, X, X
          <br>
          Inventory: 2 Bread, 2 Water
          <br>
          HP: 140/140
          <br>
          Attack Power: 15
          <br>
          Basic Attack: 15 damage
          <br>
          Basic Attack Cooldown Reduction: 25%
          <br>
          Credits: 20
          <br>
          Level: 3
          <br>
          <br>
          Whoever decides to hit first will strike first. Hyunwoo decides to use his basic ability, Stomping Foot, dealing 5 damage and increasing the cooldowns on Aya. This prevents Aya from immediately acting until her cooldowns are back. Hyunwoo can then inflict a basic attack once, dealing 15 damage, with it coming back off cooldown in 22.5 seconds (as it is 25% reduced). Aya will then have to wait for 10% of the day (assuming this day is 1 minute, this would be 6 seconds). 6 seconds pass, and Aya eats a Hamburger to heal for 20 HP. The resulting game state is as follows:
          <br>
          <br>
          Aya
          <br>
          HP: 105/105
          <br>
          Inventory: 5 Hamburger, 1 Bread, 2 Water, 1 Scrap Metal
          <br>
          <br>
          Hyunwoo
          <br>
          HP: 140/140
          <br>
          <br>
          Aya then uses Double Shot and Steady Shot, dealing 20 damage and then 60 damage over a short duration. Hyunwoo realizes this fight is not for him and immediately First Attacks away.
          <br>
          <br>
          Aya
          <br>
          HP: 105/105
          <br>
          Inventory: 5 Hamburger, 1 Bread, 2 Water, 1 Scrap Metal
          <br>
          <br>
          Hyunwoo
          <br>
          HP: 60/140
          <br>
          <br>
          You can see the general flow of combat like this, in which each action is done in relative real time and cooldowns are relatively tracked- however, in pen and paper, due to the difficulty of time zones and real time gameplay, it is relaxed, so for example, a shorter cooldown like Hyunwoo’s basic attack can be lightened and just fully reset due to the cooldown reduction, allowing Hyunwoo for 3 basic attacks in a singular round for ease of gameplay.
